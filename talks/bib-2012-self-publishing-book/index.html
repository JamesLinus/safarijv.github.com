EPUB files and formats are what I did for a living. Now I think much more about our customers, who are the readers. They are the people who get the books, the chapters, and the video clips through the browser. The files and what happens to them behind the scenes are unimportant.</span>

          <span>Some assertions about authoring systems:</span>
        </h2>
        <h3 class="c0">
          <span>Domain-specific tools are going away.</span>
        </h3>
        <p class="c0">
          <span>What I think we&#x2019;re coming to is the fact that moving from writing on paper, to typing on a typewriter, to using any of the word-processing tools (that we’ve had in the last 20 years) all fundamentally have the same user interface. You are given a white rectangle to work with and you fill it up with the written word.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0">
          <span>However, there are things that are happening outside the publishing industry that is causing my shift in thinking about whether the white rectangle is the only form of input. Could we have new writing systems? </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0">
          <span>This isn&#x2019;t really </span>
          <span class="c2">writing</span>
          <span>-specific but I noticed my own behavior shifting when it comes to GPS. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0">
          <span>I used to buy a physical device that I put in my car that I would type in where I wanted to go and that would give me driving directions. Then I moved to using an app on my phone, which was better because I didn’t need the second device. But I still had to make a conscious choice to pick up a device, open an application, and once again usually type in an address or maybe a place and that it would give me directions.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0">
          <span>And though Apple maps is terrible, it’s been very different now that I can pick up my phone and talk to the phone. I can just say, &#x201C;Directions to the vet,&#x201D; and it knows what vet that is because it can look in my address book. Then it just starts giving me directions. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0">
          <span>I don’t make any decision other than the problem I’m trying to solve, which is that I want directions. I don’t need to think about the tool, and I think that’s happening in many forms of content creation, like the integration of photo management systems right into the camera applications on our phone. You are just doing the action of taking the picture, not choosing a tool. </span>

        <p class="c0">
          <span>So they even though we’re aware that we are mostly at this point creating </span>
          <span class="c1">digital</span>
          <span>&#xA0;publications, what you use for writing is still that white rectangle. Everything you’re given as choices that you make when you edit in these tools is about the look of the words on a piece of paper, even if it’s remaining digital. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0">
          <span>I’m not sure that &#x201C;word processor&#x201D; is even the right thing; it’s a &#x201C;paper processor&#x201D; that just may not get printed. And, apologies to Adam Witwer, there are very few people who are going to write more digital-native publications by learning a markup language. I love markup languages&#x2014;even XML&#x2014;but asking people to do semantic tagging or structured markup is swimming against the tide of other content creation tools, where the tool itself is becoming invisible.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0">
          <span>On the flipside, voice-recognition used to be a tool. You used to say, &#x201C;I have a hard time writing. I need to start speaking to my computer because I have RSI.&#x201D; So you would buy a package, install it, and that would be the voice recognition. But as of today there is native voice recognition in my phone, in my computer, in my web browser, and on my gaming system. I expect them to go from pretty good to great now that they&#x2019;re becoming ubiquitous in consumer devices. I also expect the trajectory of voice to follow that of touchscreen, where we will start to see YouTube videos of small children talking to inanimate objects the way we see them try to swipe on paper magazines.</span>

          <span>Last year a lot of people were talking about their social reading platforms (and I think we are not anywhere near the end of experimenting with social reading). But looking at trends, I think it’s unlikely for us to expect large-scale adoption of collaborative and social reading and commentary happening in a specialized framework that is closely tied to the text.</span>

          <span>I think people want to talk about media &#x2013; they want to comment and they want to edit &#x2013; but want to do that close to their peers. They want to do it near other people, not necessarily near the words. The are semi-specialized applications where that link between the person and the text is important, but I’m talking about general consumer behavior. People are going to want to talk where the people are, not where the words are.</span>

          <span>For an obligatory tie-in to our company: I see some hint of an application for thisin the journey that Safari has made. </span>

        <p class="c3">
          <span>We started as a company that wanted to provide access to books because books were the place that you would learn information about programming and other topics that were relevant to programmers. In the 11 years that the company has been around, we shifted towards adding video, but those videos were professionally-produced, very much like a book. They go through the same kind of editorial process. But some of our most-widely viewed and intensely-viewed content has been just conference presentations and taped versions of seminars. Now that is certainly prepared material, but not professionally edited &#x2013; not scripted &#x2013; what was powerful about it was that it was </span>
          <span class="c0">relevant</span>
          <span>, and that it was </span>
          <span class="c0">recent</span>

          <span/>
        </p>
        <p class="c3">
          <span>I’m interested in if we can tie that back into a book &#x2013; or at least a written account &#x2013; of some of what’s compelling about events that happen in real time. I want to capture even more than just what I’m saying but what </span>
          <span class="c0">you</span>
