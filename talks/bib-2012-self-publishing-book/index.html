They are the people who get the books the chapters and the video clips through the browser. The files and what happens to them behind the scenes are unimportant.</span></p></div>

<div class="slide six columns"><h2 class="c3"><span>Some assertions about authoring systems:</span></h2><p class="c3"><span>Domain-specific tools are going away.</span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>What I think we&#8217;re coming to is the fact that moving from written (paper) typing on a typewriter to using any of the word-processing tools (that we've had in the last 20 years) all fundamentally have the same user interface. You are given a white rectangle to work with and you fill it up with the written word.</span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>However, there are things that are happening outside the publishing industry. That&#8217;s causing my shift in thinking about whether that at least the white rectangle is the only form of input. Could we have two writing systems? </span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>This isn&#8217;t really </span><span class="c0">writing</span><span>-specific but I noticed my own behavior shifting when it comes to GPS. </span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>I used to buy a physical device that I put in my car that I would type in where I wanted to go and that would give me driving directions. Then I moved to using an app on my phone, which was better because I didn't need the second device but I still had to make a conscious choice to pick up a device open an application and once again usually type in an address or maybe of a place and that it would give me directions and though Apple maps is terrible it's been very different now that I can pick up my phone and talk to the phone and just say directions to the vet and it knows what might that is because it can look in my address book and it just starts giving me directions. There's no tool their members the following but I don't make any decision other than the problem I'm trying to solve, which is that I want directions. I don't need to think about the tool, and I think that's happening in many forms of content creation like the integration of photo management systems right into the camera applications on our phone. You are just doing the action of taking the picture, not choosing a tool. </span></p></div>

<div class="slide six columns"><h2 class="c0"><span>Whereas:</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Voice recognition is mainstream.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>so they even though we're aware that we are mostly at this point creating digital publications that you live for writing is still that white rectangle and everything you're given in choices that you make when you do editing is about the look of the words on a piece of paper even if it's remaining digital and I'm not sure that word processors even the right thing it's really up it's a paper processor that just may not get printed and apologies to Adam Wittwer there are very few people who are going to write more digital native publications by learning a markup language I love markup languages even XML but that isn't that asking people to do semantic tagging or structured markup swimming against the tide of other content creation tools where the tool itself is really becoming invisible on the flipside is in trends but I did find interesting that my point away leastways experimentation voice-recognition used to be a tool used to say I have a hard time writing I need shoes start speaking to my computer because I have RSI so you would buy a package install it and that would be the voice recognition but as of today there is native voice recognition and my phone in my computer in my web browser and on my gaming system that are all pretty good to great but I expect them to go from pretty good to great now that their becoming ubiquitous in consumer devices and I also expect the trajectory of voice to follow that of touchscreen where we will start to see YouTube videos of small children talking to inanimate objects because they suspect out of four things the way we see them try to On paper magazines</span></p></div>
