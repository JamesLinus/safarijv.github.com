more recently I can now pick up my phone speak the name of the location that I want to go to it will look up where that location is and start telling me directions and even for someone who is technically capable there's a tremendous difference to me between talking to my phone and having a talkback to me and even just key in an address on of on a device</span></p></div><div class="tweets

the newer sexier word processing tools programs like right room or scrivener are still ultimately interfaces for creating words on paper I would say that they are more paper processors and where processors you are always given the viewport of a white empty rectangle and that is fundamentally not very different than a typewriter or handwriting pages and I'm not sure that's the only answer for how we can offer works we miss community have tried to introduce a more smooth semantic level of content creation by asking authors to markup text and there certainly special domains where that is effective and whole classes of offers to like me are delighted to use markup by witches but I don't think that's ever going to scale outside of specific communities and it isn't the solution to the problem of introducing semantics I might argue that that problem is unsolvable at the level of authorship and we should go a different direction on the other hand there are some other trends that I think aren't yet touching publishing that are potentially interesting to us one of them that has to me only hit mainstream and the last year or less is voice recognition which like the GPS used to be a specialty feature that you had to have a specific need for and like many things was originally most useful to the disabled community but has such broad applications that especially very recently it has started to creep into a whole range of consumer devices from phones to computers to video game systems and I expect very shortly we will see videos on YouTube of small children picking up paper books and magazines and trying to talk to them expecting that they will work like their tablet were like there television</span></p></div><div class="tweets three columns"> </div><span

at this point to correct to the text transcription anyone can do it and everyone is encouraged to do it not just to correct but to enhance we also very specifically wanted to incorporate commentary

at what we've defined over time as content that we expect people want to pay for and we've seen this journey from people pay for books to people will pay for very short books then to video which started out as professionally edited video is often produced by publishers that follow a cycle very much like traditional writing with a draft and edits and that a production phase and editing phase but when we look at our usage data we find tremendous interest in content that is not professionally edited in that same way at all we find people really want to look at conference presentations sometimes dozens of hours of conference presentations or seminars that were recorded and are available in our system treated just like books so I wandered on one level can we close that loop and go back from video is being distinct from a book to video or real time helping to create a book I'd like Keith to come up now I will turn off the transcription and say a few things about our implementation and what we're trying to capture here that we think a system like this can do that other forms of authorship To thank you</span></p></div><div class="tweets three columns"> </div><span
